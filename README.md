### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yeshapan/machine-learning-algorithms.git
cd machine-learning-algorithms
```
### 2. (Optional) Create Virtual Environment
```bash
# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
```
### 3. Install required packages

### 4. Launch Juypiter notebook

## End Note

This repository is a personal learning resource for building a deeper understanding of core machine learning algorithms. 
It's a work in progress and will grow over time as new topics are explored.
